- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

My class is called CatGPT, a play on words from the infamous ChatGPT. It is a randomizing "game" that you can play with a randomly generated cat- except you can name it and give it a size! I created a showOptions(), getTranscript(), getBreed(), toString() methods to assist in generating transcripts, randomly generating a breed, etc. 
My advice stays the same as last time. Start early and go to TA hours!
